 As product mentioned its a orthopedic mattress but I can surly say from my experience you need to see a orthopedician for your back pain. Its worst product ever used I have been through horrible nights struggling with the mattress, after 10 15 days of use mattress became so soft that it can hardly give you comfort in any position & discomfort increases on a daily basis, It gives acute pain on lower back and i feel like falling off if come any where near to the edges of the mattress. mattress simply can not hold the weight of 65kg person God knows what will happen with heavier people because of its softness you feel like your body is in waveform.
 
 We tried every possible way, rotating position of the mattress, flipping up side down in hope of getting some harmony with the mattress but nothing worked product will give discomfort and pain in all possible way.

 Pros -
 1 - cushioning is fine.
 2- price is decent
 3- wheels are moving good and does not get stuck.
 4 - recline for back support and hand support is good.
 5 - initial customer support was excellent and proper follow-up was done on emails and through phone calls when I faced some issue with the product.
 
 Cons -
 1 - material used to build the chair is not best of class.
 2 - back spine support is very loose and does not stay at the same position so you have to adjust it many times.
 3 - Thigh support is not that great as the sitting area doesn’t slide forward, which sometimes becomes little annoying.
 4 - you cannot lock multiple recline positions as there is just one option to lock or you completely unlock the recline.",https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/RJP6498JHSZPM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09RQWFTXG,Y,"['cons', 'cushioning', 'recline']",12/01/23

220,3,19/01/23,Amazon,Raj,Sofa,Sofa,1,"I recently purchased an ottoman with a 3 seater sofa, but I have been extremely disappointed with the quality and customer support. The top of the ottoman is uneven and one corner is pressed down, which is not up to par with the Acme Inc Napper sofa I bought alongside it.
 
 The customer support has been unprofessional and impractical. After I reported that the ottoman came with two loose legs, I was told a carpenter would visit within 48-72 hours to fix it. However, I never heard from them until I received a call after a couple of weeks later asking if the carpenter had visited. This pattern continued for the next three months, with weekly calls promising a visit within 48-72 hours that never materialized. It wasn't until I reached out to them on Twitter that a carpenter finally visited, but the repairs were inadequate and resulted in a cracked leg. Despite multiple attempts to resolve the issue, I am still waiting for a replacement. The latest update from customer support was that they will send all four legs with a carpenter and add a ply board at the bottom to fix the legs in place, which will unfortunately increase the height of the ottoman and make it incompatible with the sofa.
 
 Overall, I would not recommend this product due to the poor quality and frustrating customer support experience. Save yourself the time and frustration and look for a different ottoman.",https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R1MYIEGKM9GNVW/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08Q89BNGJ,Y,"['sofa', 'ottoman', 'seater']",22/12/22

243,4,23/01/23,Amazon,Exploring with AB,Accessories,Pillows,1,"Probably one of the worst pillows you can ever buy.
 
 In the beginning they appear pretty good especially as you open them out of the packaging and watch them grow big. They are quite comfortable in the beginning but as time passes by, they start losing the fluffiness and start getting flatter. After a few weeks, they just don't provide any support to the neck whatsoever.
 I recommended this pillow to my other family members also based upon my experience of first few days, but that was a bad advice. All the pillows lost all support after a few weeks.
 This is the reason they also provide you extra synthetic fibre that you can add to the pillows if they loose the fluffiness but that also won't last long.
 
 Don't go by the all 5 star reviews. Without a doubt, majority of them are fake. The rest are based only on using the pillows for a few days. As many other reviewers have ALSO mentioned, plenty of my older pillows still provide better cushioning and support than these. Acme Inc is one of the worst companies and after using many Acme Inc products I can easily suggest anyone to stay away from them. Their quality has gone down for the worst.

 2. Defective piece delivered - crack in a corner of one of the ply pieces affixed on back - shown in the attached pic
 
 3. Back side of the wardrobe is not how it is shown in the 360 degree view video on the product description page - please refer to the video attached by me
 
 4. Returning the product is a nightmare - even if they agree to the same - They told me that they will get my wardrobe picked up in a week's time but they cannot guarantee when their partners will come for pick up - so either someone stays at home all the time or leave the wardrobe with a neighbor or a security guard if they ever have to move out
 
 5. Despite assurances, they won't pick up the product nor update you on status of the same - I waited patiently for a week for the pickup that never happened.
 
 6. Upon follow up, I was told that the pick up was delayed due to unavoidable circumstances and that the same can be scheduled again as per my convenience. However, I do not want to be grounded for any more period of time, so I gave up.
 
 7. Amazon guarantee program does not seem to be of much help since they are dependent on the seller picking up the product for return which, unfortunately, in this case, never seems to happen.
 
 I have finally decided to retain the defective product and see how long it lasts. Hope it will last me at least for a year, the warranty period of the product.

 Firstly this mattress is just foam. Not sure how they term it as orthopaedic. It simply sinks in when you sit on it. Senior citizens can find this very difficult to balance them selves while getting off the bed.
 
 Secondly the mattress begins to sink in after a few days of use. We tried rotating the bed which helps only for a few days. This gives back pain while waking up.

Overall product rating is 4/5 as I felt the storage design could be better, but never the less its seems to be value for money at this price point.
 
 However the installation service was very bad as one of the carpenters seemed to be in a hurry and slipped his electric screw driver several times on the polished surface of the bed frame resulting in long permanent scratches that looks very bad. He did this around all the three screws at front right outer surface of the frame, and didn't stop at the first instance which could have been forgiven as a human error. So, installation service is 1/5.",https://www.flipkart.com/reviews/BDDG6G4GYZ2MQ8XC:2059?reviewId=0c29cbc0-125f-4ab2-add6-7574688c145a,Y,"['sturdy', 'durability', 'storage']",10/02/23

On Flipkart you only get 30 days warranty and 10 days return time period which is quite less for testing the mattress.

The sofa was wet and covered in dirt and grime, with its outer covering torn in several places. Upon inquiry, the delivery boys informed me that the product got wet in the rain during shipment.
 I was extremely disappointed to see the condition of the sofa upon delivery. I had high hopes for the product, but the state in which it arrived was unacceptable. I understand that accidents can happen during transportation, but as a customer, I expect the product to arrive in a new and undamaged state.
 As a result of the poor condition of the sofa, I am requesting either a replacement or a refund from Acme Inc. I believe that the company should take responsibility for the condition in which the product arrived and provide a satisfactory resolution to the issue.
 I was excited to receive the SnoozePro 5 seater sofa and had high expectations for its quality and comfort. However, the product that I received was far from satisfactory, and I believe that I am entitled to a resolution that meets my expectations as a customer.

 Pros: 1) Price.
 Cons:
 1) Storage. It’s not a box storage nor a hydraulic storage like you would expect. There are four compartments under the mattress and nothing on the underside apart from a thin paper like layer which is put right on the floor.
 2) If you have read and understood point no 1 then you would immediately question about cleaning under the bed. You can’t, there’s no gap between the bed and the floor. Since the bed is literally on the floor and using the floor as the storage.
 3) The height of the bed is low so it’s not comfortable to sit on as there is no underthigh support specifically if you’re on the taller side.
 
 The only reason to get this bed would be budget constraints as it offers tremendous value and you are willing to live with the above compromises.",https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R60GRAFXKIAHR/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08Q8FCYJL,Y,"['mattress', 'cons', 'bed']",26/03/23

 Pros:
 Affordable
 Nice Color
 
 Cons:
 Sitting in centre raises the ends up creating a sensation of falling off the mattress.
 Fitting on the single bed was not good, there is slight gap length wise.
 The mattress doesn't feel sturdy enough on lying down.
 
 
 Didn't return as we hardly use that bed and it's more for afternoon lazying and being used as deewan in the living area.
 
 NOT A PROFESSIONAL INTERACTION WITH THE BRAND:
 Acme Inc folks called for the feedback and I gave them this honest feedback of mine to which they asked I should wash the cover once and see if it solves. I didn't as I said we hardly use the bed so I wouldn't return the mattress and that's why didn't go for their suggested solution.
 
 Today they called again seeking feedback, I told them that I have already provided my detailed feedback in the last call. To which they replied that the last person seems to have not submitted the feedback, can I give it again to which I denied as it appears that they do not want to record any bad/average feedbacks.

 ***Here is my experience *
 The product was received in a potli-type bag, the bag was damaged from the outside but the package was safe. After someday, of receipt mattress, I received a call from the Acme Inc team regarding a review of the mattress I said facing back pain and neck pain from the day of starting he said to wait for 30 days as it takes time to adjust you will be fine after 30 days of use he also advises using both sides as per my choice. But even after 40 days problem was the same heavy back pain and neck pain in the morning as I complain about on Amazon. Amazon executive registered a complaint against the seller he said the seller will solve your problem. After 2 days I received a call from Acme Inc I explained my problem and he said sorry sir we can't do anything please contact the seller (Amazon ) as the discomfort issue can't be covered By warranty than again I contact Amazon and explain what Acme Inc said and they said sorry sir we can't do anything as your return period already over you, please contact Acme Inc.
 Now I am helpless from both sides.
 
 Not just me my wife also faced back pain in the morning she isn't ready to sleep on it so now the mattress is useless.
 
 Please read review before buying don't go for 4.5 stars rating.

1186,16,19/04/23,Amazon,pushpank agrawal,Mattress,OMF,1,"Style Name: 72x36x6 inchPattern Name: Original MattressSize: Single
 I have purchased “Acme Inc Orthopedic Memory Foam 6-Inch Single Size Mattress (72x36x6 Inches, Medium Firm, White)”. I am very disappointed with the product as well as customer service. My review is below.
 
 1) NOT AT ALL ORTHOPEDIC!!
 It is a very poor quality mattress. Don’t know why the description says Orthopedic mattress as I feel back pain every morning. This mattress is too soft will completely sink may result in back pain and spinal problems in the long run. Also as it is too soft and cannot be used for sitting (only for sleeping). You will fall from the bed if you sit close to the edge.
 
 2) FALSE REVIEWS
 If you go through the negative reviews you will understand their support ensures that only 5 star reviews remain and the rest get removed. Instead they should accept genuine rating and work on improving their product.
 
 3) FALSE PROMISE FROM Acme Inc CUSTOMER SUPPORT
 If you raise the back pain issue to the customer support, their standard reply to your issue will be that
 a) It take 15-20 days for your body to adjust to new mattress OR
 b) Kindly invert the mattress and use it for 15-20 days
 My question to them is, if they know that 15-20 is required by the body to adjust to new mattress they why only provide ‘10 days Replacement only’. Instead they should provide 30 days refund/replacement.
 I had requested for refund from but the status is ‘Return pending seller approval’. I received call from Acme Inc support and they provided me with the above solutions and if these don’t work then they told that they will assist with the return. I asked them how I will request refund if the period is open, to which their executive assured that this case shall remain open till then. To my surprise, in the evening I received the following e-mail “Acme Inc has closed the return request listed below. Reason for the closure of your request: Solved a technical issue”.
 After discussion with the support executive I was about to give it another try form 2-3 days, but this type of false promise ensured that I should not trust the Acme Inc Brand.
 
 4) MY RECOMMENDATION
 As they only have online store and not physical store you cannot experience the mattress before buying, I would recommend you to buy a mattress in-store after experiencing it.",https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R3KTLBLAJ6CAEG/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RAEXNIK,N,"['mattresssize', 'mattress', 'bed']",17/04/23

Checked the product page to see the expected height - it was mentioned as 45cm - 55cm. On measuring it for my chair, found it to be ~47cm at max height. Reported this to Acme Inc and that's the start of the horrible experience.
 
 I took a photo with a measuring tape and provided that as part of initial support request itself. They called by after a few days and asked me to provide a video of the measurement. I did that as well and the same is attached here. After a few days again, they called back and told me some story about the production team needing another video which has to be taken based on a demo video that they would share!
 
 Take a look at the video and decide for yourself if the issue is clear to you or not! If you deciding to buy a Acme Inc product and you run into a support issue, be ready to take video taking courses and certifications to be able to share data with them, they will take their sweet time and do all R&D.

Got it installed and there were 5 legs inside the bed for its support, but to my surprise, 4 out of 5 legs were shorter. I immediately raised a complaint to replace the same. A rude telecaller from Acme Inc calls me thrice a day and says that it is a non returnable product and we can provide replacement of defective part only in 15-18 days. You can get it repaired locally. Finally I had to tell her that I will talk to you through Amazon people only.
 
 I dont think it is a trusted seller and Amazon should take necessary action against them or remove them. I will never buy a Acme Inc product again nor recommend.
 
 Another problem is that, when I called Acme Inc Customer care, they say to contact Amazon for support. Acme Inc Customer Care claims that support on purchases from Amazon will be managed by Amazon.
 
 That's not OK. Because of juggling between Amazon and Acme Inc, my return window will be closed. How can a company cover 3 years warranty when they are not even able to resolve the complaint of a new product.

1686,23,07/06/23,Amazon,Sunil J.,HW Furniture,Sheesham Bed,1,"TL;DR If you love your sleep and peace of mind, avoid this product.
 
 Sequence of events:
 
 1. It took Acme Inc 4 delivery attempts and 3 replacements across 16 days to finally deliver a defect free unit.
 2. Each time (i.e. 4 times), I stayed back at home all day to receive delivery as they won't tell us what time they will be reaching. But the customer is expected to be at home when it comes - it could be 10 in the morning or 8 in the evening. Our time isn't as important as theirs.
 3. Their staff drags the product all the way from the truck until your door -- through the corridor, lift etc. Including the MDF boards which are brittle and easily damaged if handled rough. It is too much effort for them to lift it to avoid damage to your product bought with hard earned money.
 4. The staff did not have any tool to fix the nails, so what did they do? They used the wooden legs of the bed to hit on the nails and bolts to push them in.
 5. The product delivered to me the first time had manufacturing defect and couldn't be assembled -- their staff tried doing some 'jugaad' to somehow force assemble -- so they don't have to take it back. It appears these guys have targets and are almost always in super hurry to leave.
 6. The second time the product delivered had multiple defects -- 1) wood chipped off at many places 2) Foam tape for support missing 3) big gaps b/w the MDF boards that be breeding ground for insects etc
 7. The staff tried justifying most defects so they don't have to take the defective product back. For eg. I was told the gaps b/w the MDF boards are by design so our fingers can get in to life them when needed.
 8. Extremely poor workmanship overall in general and these guys are always in hurry
 9. The third time I was made to wait at home all day but it never arrived
 10. The fourth time after escalation to their entire leadership, I was finally offered a defect-free product and a good competent carpenter
 11. It took at least 75+ calls and emails and multiple whatsapp exchanges across the Acme Inc management and hierarchy to resolve this. Most of them including their top leadership don't care to respond or even acknowledge. You are left to suffer their incompetence.
 12.

1698,23,08/06/23,Amazon,Rikhath,EW Furniture,Office chair,1,"I purchased an office chair from Acme Inc about 12 months back, hoping for a reliable and durable seating solution. However, my experience with the chair has been quite disappointing. Despite my limited use, with sparing reclining only once or twice a day, the chair's back snapped unexpectedly, causing me to fall.
 
 As someone weighing around 75 kgs, well within the chair's weight capacity, I expected sturdiness and flexibility in the chair's construction. Unfortunately, the quality and resilience of the plastic used in the chair are questionable. It is disheartening to encounter such a major issue with the chair's back, especially considering how lightly I have used it.
 
 Now, I find myself faced with a dilemma. I am unsure if Acme Inc offers replacement parts for their chairs, specifically the back in this case. Alternatively, I may have to spend more money to purchase an entirely new chair. It is frustrating to realize that the price I paid for this chair did not guarantee the longevity and reliability I expected.
 
 In conclusion, I am deeply disappointed with the durability of the Acme Inc office chair. The unexpected snapping of the back has left me with concerns about the overall quality of the product. I hope Acme Inc takes these issues seriously and works towards improving the durability and construction of their chairs in the future.",https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R2CNYMWQ7HMMDP/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BZ8LH5KT,Y,"['chair', 'chairs', 'sturdiness']",06/06/23

So whenever a customer wants to buy something from any website, apart from their own research they mostly rely on the reviews and the customer experience of the item. However, it is almost sad to see that some sellers such as Acme Inc are taking advantage of this process and generating a fake buzz around their products. Here's what happened.
 
 After I got my order delivered, I quite liked it from the get-go and I never had a complaint about it ever since. However, maybe after a day or two of receiving the item I was contacted by a Acme Inc associate on the phone. Primarily I was surprised to receive this call since I believed Amazon always had a tight policy around sharing customer personal information. Post the discussion around the product and my personal experience of the delivery process I was pressurized by the Acme Inc associate to rate their product positively and share a screenshot with them over WhatsApp.
 
 Now, as I mentioned I already liked the product and I was going to provide a positive review anyway but because of this pressure created by the Acme Inc associate, I was forced to do something where I felt I had no choice. While ordering this item I never thought why all the products from the aforementioned brand mostly have positive ratings and now I know.

 First of all, let me begin by saying that the initial impression of the bean bag was quite positive. It appeared to be comfortable and well-designed, and I was excited to have a cozy addition to my living room. However, my enthusiasm quickly turned into disappointment when the seams started to unravel.
 
 The tearing of the bean bag is simply unacceptable. I expected it to withstand regular usage, but it couldn't even last a few weeks. The fabric used is clearly of subpar quality, unable to handle the slightest strain or pressure. It's as if the manufacturer used the flimsiest materials possible, sacrificing durability for cost-cutting measures.
 
 What's even more frustrating is that I didn't subject the bean bag to any excessive use or abuse. I used it mainly for casual seating, and I expected it to hold up under such normal conditions. However, the seams simply couldn't handle the regular weight and movement, resulting in an embarrassing tear.",https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R2JGH0A1FSVP9Z?ref=pf_vv_at_pdctrvw_srp,Y,"['bean', 'fabric', 'durability']",05/07/23

1972,28,12/07/23,Amazon,Ratnesh Shukla,Mattress,Dual Comfort,1,"My recent purchase of a Acme Inc Bed and Acme Inc Mattress in queen size has turned into a complete disaster. The blatant incompatibility between these supposedly matching products is beyond frustrating.
 
 I expected a seamless fit and a comfortable sleeping experience, considering that both the bed and mattress are from the same brand and in the same size. However, the mattress refuses to snugly fit into the bed frame, creating a constant slide that makes sleep impossible and discomfort inevitable. Despite my efforts to secure the mattress, it remains an uncooperative nuisance.
 
 The lack of attention to detail and quality control by Acme Inc is truly appalling. How can a brand sell products that are incompatible with each other? This negligence shows a complete disregard for customer satisfaction and reflects poorly on the company as a whole.
 
 To make matters worse, when I sought assistance from Acme Inc's customer service, their response was utterly unsatisfactory. The lack of empathy and unwillingness to address the issue demonstrated their indifference toward resolving customer concerns. It appears that their only interest lies in making the sale, with no regard for providing post-purchase support.
 
 I strongly caution potential buyers against considering Acme Inc products, particularly if you are planning to purchase both the bed and mattress. The severe incompatibility issue I experienced is not something to be taken lightly. Don't subject yourself to the frustration and inconvenience that I went through.
 
 In summary, the Acme Inc Bed and Mattress have proven to be an abysmal failure. The complete lack of fit between the two products, combined with the abysmal customer service, has left me deeply dissatisfied and regretful of my purchase. I vehemently discourage anyone from wasting their hard-earned money on these unreliable and uncomfortable sleep solutions.",https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R36HJMRALKPRDK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RACAUJM,Y,"['mattress', 'wakefit', 'bed']",07/07/23

 In the description as well in instruction manual and video it is showing that head rest cushion will be already attached to the head rest handle and all you have to do is just fix this head rest to back rest with 2 bolts but in my case head rest cushion was not attached to handle and I had to struggle almost 1-1.5 hrs just for attaching cushion into handle and believe me it's not an easy task, after all my struggle got waste then asked help from a carpenter who luckily working in my neighbor'house, it has taken 15-20 minutes but finally he was able to fix it (don't know how).
 Acme Inc customer service is waste of time!! although Acme Inc itself selling this chair on Amazon but they have no record of sale.Even after sharing name, my phone no. Invoice, order Id they said we have no record or data of your or this chair and they ask me to deal with amazon team. Very disappointed and worried about the warranty of this chair
 Note-- My advise to all buyer who is going to buy this chair, after opening the box check the headrest part first, if it is already assembled then no worries other wise try to assemble headrest part first otherwise all your hard work will go waste, Acme Inc team is totally useless and will ask you to contact Amazon and Amazon team will ask you to return the chair so all your labour will go wasted.",https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/RH25A2CZJTY61?ref=pf_vv_at_pdctrvw_srp,Y,"['headrest', 'chair', 'assembled']",08/07/23

2111,29,20/07/23,Amazon,Shivani Y,EW Furniture,Taurus,1,"I recently purchased the Acme Inc Double Bed, and I must say it has been a complete disaster from start to finish. The poor installation of this bed has left me utterly dissatisfied and regretting my decision.
 
 To begin with, the fitting of the bed is absolutely atrocious. There are wide and unsightly gaps between the bed's structure and the floor sheets, making it a breeding ground for dust and debris. It's as if the bed was hastily put together without any attention to detail or quality control. As a result, any belongings I try to store under the bed will inevitably become a dusty mess in no time.
 
 I cannot stress enough how important it is not to be swayed by the positive reviews on Amazon. I fell into that trap, believing that this product would live up to the hype, but it has proven to be nothing more than a disappointment. The glowing reviews must be fabricated or written by people who received a different product altogether.
 
 I had high hopes for this bed, but it is clear that the product is far from being up to the mark. The lack of proper fitting and finishing makes it an eyesore in my bedroom, and it fails to serve its basic function as a reliable box bed.
 
 Moreover, the customer service I received when attempting to address the issue was equally lackluster. They showed little concern for my grievances and were unhelpful in resolving the matter. It's apparent that the company's focus is on selling a subpar product rather than ensuring customer satisfaction.
 
 If you're considering purchasing a Acme Inc Double Bed, I strongly advise against it. Don't be fooled by any positive feedback you come across, as it's most likely a far cry from reality. The poor installation and lack of attention to detail make this bed a terrible investment.

However, their drill stopped working after they drilled initial holes. They left saying it will be finished next day. No one contacted the next day and when I called those people, they said another technician will be assigned.
 
 After 2 days, I got another carpenter to install it, but after installation, we realised that the holes that Acme Inc guys drilled were not straight (one side was higher than other side from the ground). To avoid drilling extra holes, I tried to let it be.
 
 After another few days, got a call from Acme Inc team to complete the job. This technician was rather skilled and completed the job by drilling more holes and aligning the unit properly. As a result, there are total of 12 holes in the wall now with 4 of them a waste.
 
 So during installation, please pay attention to the guys who are installing it, they might be noobs and might end up doing things wrong way.

And the problem is happening at other places of the mattress as well.
 
 And the very next day I had a complete back pain because of this thing. As a customer I am extremely disappointed with Acme Inc and Amazon for giving me such a bad product and also have lost all faith in this brand.
 
 Another mattress has also come, that too is not proper this one is very soft, it sinks completely on sitting. And Its grid is also not proper, it keeps on slipping here while sitting or sleeping on mattress and the grid is not proper fitting, there is a gap in the borders and in middle.

2375,32,07/08/23,Amazon,Sagar,Mattress,Elevate Spring,1,"When I first saw the advertisements for this mattress, it seemed like the answer to all my sleeping problems. They boasted about its superior comfort, back support, and luxurious feel. Eager to improve my sleep quality, I decided to give it a try. Little did I know that it would become a nightmare that would haunt my nights.
 
 The first issue arose with the so-called ""superior comfort."" Instead of sinking into a cloud of coziness, I felt like I was lying on a lumpy boulder. The supposed ""memory foam"" felt more like a distant memory, as it provided zero contouring or support to my body. My spine suffered the most, as I woke up with aching back muscles every morning.
 
 And speaking of support, the Acme Inc Spring Mattress was an utter failure. They promised optimal alignment for a restful sleep, but all I got was a misaligned mess. It seemed like the springs were placed haphazardly, creating uncomfortable pressure points that made me toss and turn all night, seeking a position that would bring some relief.
 
 As if that wasn't enough, the mattress's durability left much to be desired. It was supposed to be built to last, but it started sagging within a few Days of use. It felt like I was sinking into a black hole every time I lay down, and no amount of flipping or rotating seemed to make a difference.
 
 The worst part was dealing with their customer service. When I reached out to them with my concerns and dissatisfaction, they showed no empathy or willingness to help. It felt like they had no interest in standing behind their product or ensuring customer satisfaction.
 
 In the end, I had to cut my losses and replace the Acme Inc Spring Mattress with a more reliable one from a different brand. It was a hard lesson learned – don't fall for the fancy marketing and promising claims without researching thoroughly.
 
 If you value your sleep and your sanity, stay far away from the Acme Inc Spring Mattress. It's a gamble you don't want to take, as you'll likely end up regretting it, just like I did. Save yourself the pain and invest in a mattress that truly lives up to its promises.

 I recently purchased a 4-door wardrobe, and overall, I am satisfied with the quality and design. The wardrobe itself looks elegant and provides ample storage space for my belongings. The carpentry work seems well-done, and the finishing is good.
 
 However, there is an issue that needs attention. Unfortunately, the carpenter forgot to include the locking slot on the doors as promised. While I was provided with a key, it's disappointing that I am unable to use it due to the missing locking mechanism. Security and privacy are important factors for me, and this oversight is quite inconvenient.
 
 I appreciate the timely delivery and the carpenter's professionalism during the installation process. I hope the issue with the missing locking slot can be resolved promptly. If this matter is addressed, I would be more than willing to give a higher rating for an otherwise well-crafted wardrobe.
 
 In conclusion, the wardrobe's quality and design are commendable, but the absence of the locking slot is a significant drawback. I hope for a resolution to this issue soon.
